# Gillespie-Algorithm
In this repository, we have both MATLAB and Python code for simulating simple birth-death (BD) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes via Gillespie algorithm. 
## Introduction
The Gillespie algorithm is a stochastic simulation method used to simulate the time evolution of systems with discrete states, particularly in chemical and biological processes where reactions occur randomly over time. It was introduced by Dan Gillespie in 1976, and it's widely used in systems biology to model reactions inside cells, such as gene expression, protein interactions, and other biochemical processes that involve random events.
